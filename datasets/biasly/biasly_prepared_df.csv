What's different this year is the record number of women running and winning up and down the ticket. One factor there and elsewhere is backlash over the Senate's treatment of Anita Hill. A woman's voice does not count in America today.,0

"I would relax, Huffy. You have for the first time in life a woman who is interested in you. Dead or alive, which is quite an improvement.",0
"She wore it. You know, she liked little boys. She couldn't help herself.",0
"Little Women. Yes, I am reading this book. Do you not remember me from the park?",0
"You are crazy, Ruby. You are a crazy old woman. You shouldn't call me Ruby.",0
"Sometimes it feels like the hotter the model, the dumber the product. And I believe it's done to keep us in line. But... a lot of the time, the products marketed towards women have to do with two categories.",0
"She's had a turbulent life. Better suck her back quick. God, dude, it could be anywhere.",0
"I'm not the first, am I? What? The first woman you've done this to?",0
"She did an inventory after that break-in. Not even a single seahorse out of place. Her words, not mine.",0
"After a while, she threw herself off the tower. She died. You're lying.",0
"She won't let anything happen to that girl. I promise you that, ma'am. Oh, you didn't.",0
"You'll remember when we see her. But I don't know. She's a bitter social reject who can never feel good about herself, so to even the playing field she makes everyone feel bad.",0
"Does your soon-to-be baby mama know her? Drama, Sloan and I haven't been together for six months. You haven't been with anyone else.",0
"So you only take her once a year, anyway, but... Yeah. Because I always get worried about, like, how often you're supposed to take' em in for shots and everything. Yeah.",0
"So, what are you here for? What are you here for? I'm here because I need some goddamn money... and I'm the only idiot in the world I know who would cut up her credit cards... to prove a point to herself.",0
Sid! Sneak attack! Do-si-do!,0
Nothing. I sold him a cannoli in high school. Half the people in Jersey sold Joe Morelli their cannoli.,0
"Just as I know Jenna, showered your child with love, which she herself has not experienced. Together with a man, she loves above all else and with whom she wants to build a family. Do you really not want you to him at least should give a chance also to make a decision?",0
"Huh? Don't count on it, Savage. Only an uncivilized brute threatens people.",0
You fuck off. My mother was right when she said you're awful. Fuck you. ,0
And you're gonna hear that it was because my mom committed herself when I was eight. That's a long scar. How'd you get it?,0
If the sea carried it out here... there's a reason. I have to go sign the book. It's not time yet!,0
"I actually met her at Santa Monica Pier, and we shot under the boardwalk. Got a little naughty on the beach with a little nude shoot. She was naked under the boardwalk for a while, and definitely a lot of people saw, but people seemed pretty psyched about it.",0
I'm just gonna have a quick shower. I'm so jet-lagged. I got it.,0
"And I'm not saying anything negative about them, I'm a very, very liberal woman, but my daughter can be eccentric. Well, if you need anything, you know where to find us. Winston and I would love to have you over for breakfast.",0
"Thanks for coming. Here, take a seat. Thanks.",0
Now. That woman's ashes are sitting on a punk-ass shelf in a closet in a goddamn closet. That's no way to leave a person.,0
"You love her? I do. First time I saw her was on this river, just up from here.",0
"I hated school. I never had to work, my parents.. My parents never had careers.",0
Not so bad. We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here. This confident woman... has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her... because she wants to kill y'all.,0
"Hey, I'm just saying. Just saying. In the end, does all that smarts really pay off?",0
"I feel so shitty. I know, man. I know.",0
"She decorated with that glass angel shit. They're called figurines. They're called figurines, and I like em'.",0
"I really wish I could, Leanne, but if we don't get Patty's tuition in full, she can't start her new classes next week. And we all love Patty, so I really hope you can figure something out. All right, you know what, I wanted the airline points, but whatever, just put it on this.",0
I'm all scribbled out. I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it. I'll talk to her about it.,0
"Get a little self-respect. Self-respect! Anyway, unpleasantries aside, tonight is a very important event, the hunt.",0
"When you went off to school, you discovered a whole new world and new friends. We blamed their influence on you... but the truth is, that although you had our hearts, we did not have yours. We were losing you, and I didn't know what to do.",0
"Obama's stupid e-mail. Cheyenne saw it. Yo, Hendrix, what are you doing?",0
Let her do it herself. FATHER Mary! FATHER,0
"But we loved with a love that was more than love, I and Annabel Lee ; with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago, in this kingdom by the sea, a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling my Annabel Lee, so that her highborn kinsman came and bore her away from me, to shut her up in a sepulcher, in this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me.",0
"Of course. Sometimes the roles we're forced to play in life are difficult to understand. Like your mother, Dorothy who, for the good of sailors everywhere, lived the life of a prostitute.",0
"Falling in love, falling hard you know. I'm hit. Going down in flames.",0
"Yeah, I think that she would've said the truth is hard to come by. Yeah, but we'd all be lost without it, wouldn't we? I suppose.",0
"Never heard of him. She doesn't try that bull shit, of course, on her regulars. She's in trouble.",0

"That's when he started showin' who he really was. He dropped her down a flight of stairs after whooping' her half to death. She lost the baby, he made it so...",0
You can be with her. Katie's more attractive. Yeah.,0
"

But quickly found that the classical arts didn't always cater to girls like her. She had used her mother's attitude as a way of transforming herself. "" Use what you got to get what you need, Erica. "" Those were the echoes of her mother.

It's insolence, the nerve of that hapless Jew. He proposes that a stray, a cast-off become queen. Mordecai said she was an orphan.

"What about the thing where the sharia law is back? And there was a firebombing the other day. Yeah, I think it's worth the risk.",0
You had that the whole time? You don't grab life by the horns with an American express platinum card. My mother left the first time when I was 8 to find herself.,0
You still need a strategist for your little army? Someone to put together a team... to shut down Aquaman and Wonder Woman? L... Yes.,0
"Yo, you gon' go to jail. Nah, she's, like, 18. I don't mean to be disrespectful, miss.",0

You want white? We got whiskey. We got shine.,0
"I love you, Wyatt. So, I'm thinking about inventing this food that's literally just balls of bacon that you eat with your hands. Can you just slice some cheddar?",0
"Oh, this... is your daughter. She has more fight than your son. Perhaps, she should be in the ring?",0
She presents herself better than anyone I've ever met. I think there was some sexual tension. I've always wanted sexual tension.,0
It is the truth. She is not a woman you can trust with your heart. I do not understand why you married her.,0
"Her blood was contaminated. "" Careful with the bathwater. "" I want to see the Tiles again. It'30.",0
"Are you in? That was a long time ago, and I don't want to go down that path again, see some young woman like this get her brains bashed in like Danielle. Hey, all right, fine, great!",0

"MAN : And he's staying there At the dos ciento cuarenta y uno Haddock Road. Yeah, he's staying here.",0

"Unfortunately, dogs learn. To this day, Roadie will not eat or drink out of a bowl that she's never met. Until she does her little Army crawl.",0
"Holy "" Valkyrie "" on Blu-ray, is that Tom Cruise? Sometimes you just got ta say what the fuck. Make your move.",0
You're not acting like a grownup. You got the rest of your life to follow this woman around a grocery store. Stop!,0
"Oh, and she she has these beautiful hands. Oh, dancer's hands. You're... A dancer too?",0
You're not that pretty anymore. Which hand is the cello playing hand? I heard you are going to grace us at the talent show.,0
It could fucking happen. I haven't seen any women with one! Where would you even have gotten an idea like this?,0
I don't I believe in God. Your father was a good man. Whoever did this.,0
"Yeah, you disappeared, man. Yeah, what can I say. I had a thing about French women.",0
What are you doing? Look out! Wonder Woman!,0
"You know what? I think more women should feel empowered in their body. Thank you, Jonathan.",0
Turns out she's been trying to bring down Masovich for years. My kind of woman. They disappeared into the jungle.,0

Kate will. She will rot in the cell until they drag her kicking and screaming to legal injection. And I'll find someone else.,0
"You're a person who can't defend herself against her worst feelings. You feel the things most of us run away from, the things most of us are just too bottled up to feel. Now are we going to have sex?",0
"So she knows about us? No, not exactly. Jesus, I almost had a coronary!",0
Do you really think Bethany would have stabbed herself in the chest? Or do you think it's more likely Hannah would stab her sister... because she suspected her of sleeping with her husband? What do you think?,0

"It's a little girl, here. Ruth. Named after her great-grandmother.",0
Of course I do. Her well-being is the most important thing in the world to me. I don't think being cooped up in this mausoleum is good for her.,0
Why did she say it looked like an animal bite? She's a lying piece of shit. All doctors are.,0
"You told me you wanted to learn how to take a punch. Well, you think you're ready? Listen, when I send someone over to your house, there is an implicit trust that you know how to behave like an adult, right?",0

"September 4th, 1941. I'm leaving home today. I don't know for how long, but it's one less mouth to feed, and maybe Mama can get her medicine now.",0

"You really have a way with people, Grayson. Do you think he's really dead? I don't know.",0

"You know, ... I wonder if your Games will be as good as your mom's? Dad, please. I'm sure 's Games will be better than your Games.",0
I don't believe it. They've managed the impossible. What an achievement!,0
Sorry. She's wired in. Let's see if this thing still has some life in it.,0
She's a grown adult. She can take care of herself. So it's obviously not you.,0
Do not treat me like an old woman. You are an old woman. What?,0

"We smoke each of our entire joints by ourselves. And I'm sitting on a couch and she's sitting on chair, and about two hours go by before we realize none of us have spoken. Two hours I'm not exaggerating at all.",0
"Has she opened her doors? Not yet, sir. You ever start a war, Mr. Bruni?",0
"We come to do a job, and we finish at all costs. And the problem with that is, it has made women believe that, like, you're perfect. And why would a guy ever walk away?",0
"Can you do that? Yeah! Yeah, just go.",0

"I feel lucky. Just like my mom, the glass is always half empty. Is this her?",0
You are amazing. Ohh! I love it.,0
"You know, waiting for the kids to get a little older. Waiting for me to lose almost all desire for her, whatsoever. Did she lose patience with you?",0

I'm fine. It's... that's not you. It's the excessive alcohol.,0
"That's a crazy woman carrying' around a box... like fuckin' Lionel on the Peanuts... and he's hangin' out with dead niggas and I'm crazy? So, what am I supposed to do with all this? Maybe you weren't ready!",0

Don't forget to wash your dishes. I hate her. I know.,0
Now can we go home? Why? I thought we were having fun.,0
"It just feels like you're on fire all of a sudden! You just want to dunk into a shower. All over the city, they should have, like, big dunk tanks so menopausal women can just hop in them any time.",0
"Girl, how late am I? I'm thinking I'm five minutes late, right? What did you do to her?",0
"Large, red... I looked directly. I was there. He looked into my eyes when I was praying, trying to find a signal.",0
This pearl's from Chinese most famous woman's tomb. Very good. You are a true expert.,0
Which way are they headed? Are they facing the same direction you're going? I can't tell.,0
"This woman stole her identity. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're making a huge leap here.",0
"To think, i could have hooked up with Matt at the party, but i said no. You would not even cheat on a math test. I can just see you dining on Wiener and Balls.",0
"Told me what? What haven't you told me that this woman and her children know that I don't... apart from that you're not coming to New York for Christmas! Well, it was meant to be a surprise, darling.",0
Yeah. Daisy. Don't you talk to me.,0
Are the hands of the Prophetess so clean that you follow her without question? My orders come directly from the Lady herself. I have nothing to doubt and I answer to no one.,0
"Hi, my name is John Paul George. I'm looking for an Ed... Yeah, I can call back.",0
And the days that I don't write to her I feel like cr-I feel like I wanna die. I don't care what anybody thinks about me! I don't care what anybody thinks about me.,0
We have this idea of how things should unfold. But sometimes we're missing the signs that are right before our eyes. We have to start our family now.,0
"I don't think she's a fan, Doug. I hope it will touch me in my private parts. What the fuck was that?",0
"It sucks. It sucks. I think as a woman as you get older, you get lazier just by looking around.",0
Irish skin. Mike's a lucky man to find someone like you. You got chocolate on your face.,0
We ditched her. Yeah. We left her all alone in the woods by herself.,0
Kill her! Kill the demon! What's the matter?,0
"Brilliant idea you had, bringin' her here. It's your fault.",0
All right. This requires a machete. What the fuck is she doing?,0
"But you are pretty. Oh, shit! Dude, I am such a fan.",0
About the credit cards that I'd gotten by forging her father's signature. About the counterfeit checks. About stealing the van.,0
"Women are... well, let's just say we're mysterious. All right. All right, I'll remember that.",0
"And no one believes a single word of it. If I hadn't lived it, I wouldn't believe it myself. There'll be other stories.",0
I love it. It's happenin'. All right.,0
"Now look, Travis, you got to use your feet. Your feet need to be wider apart than they normally used to. Feel your balance through your cleats.",0
"No wonder she couldn't take it anymore. Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy. Not worth it.",0
"You are about to become very rich, Rayna. Which means you'll have to be a little more careful... about the company you keep. So many people have such terrible agendas... like perhaps your friend here.",0
"She's fine she's just fuck you. Whoa, that's a first. Hi, bettina.",0
Now show me the witch. A witch? What?,0
"Amo, Amo! Don't give this woman any trouble. No, I won't.",0
"Seriously, Laura? You need to choose who you want to be friends with because after this trip, I am done with her. Ooh, nice friends you got.",0
That girl killed herself. You look like a ghost. If you die... I will kill you.,0
I know I'm probably the last person you want to hear from right now... but I've been where you are. I know how deep it hurts. She wouldn't want you to give up now.,0
""" Aah, aah, gah-gah! "" And I'm like, "" This isn't gonna work. "" So I went back up to my hotel room and I got on Twitter. I'm thinking there's got to be a female in the area who just sent me a message saying that she wants to hook up right now, and there was totally a message like that.",0
"I want create a race of atomic super men and women with her. If she'll have me, of course. If she won't, hey, I'll adopt.",0
I thought you laid that burden responsibility? I thought you laid that burden down when she took legal action. I thought you laid that burden down when she took legal action.,0
Come on. Camera's ruined from the water damage. SD card still works.,0
She hates me! Hate is a strong word. And she is a strong woman!,0
"Does she? Okay, you guys keep working. Okay, what's going on?",0
"And we just have to remember that while she's deployed that she is tough and can take care of herself. I know that. But, dad, I just...",0
"And I was really drunk, and she kind of forced herself on me. Then she broke up with me the next day. Why would you make up stories like that?",0
I can't see anything. How do you turn on the night vision? I don't know.,0
"You, me, yes. Here, I'll show you. Firm grip, then that way.",0
"I always thought I'd find a great guy, have him take care of me, raise a family, live happily ever after. I kind of figured out along the way that I like taking care of myself. You're the only woman I ever wanted to marry, have a family with, you know, it was just you.",0
"Mal must be counting the days until the Royal Cotillion, when she will officially become a Lady of the Court. Whoa. Easy, girl.",0
No. You want to go? You want to leave?,0
"Oh, God damn it! Isolate the coordinates. Yes, sir.",0
"Well, so good that he has you. Excuse me, I'm running late. She's lost a lot of weight.",0
"Uh, mostly. Uh... I take care of the parts, manage the gear... You're like a whiz in that class.",0
And I'm sure there are men that feel this way. But we like to scare women when they're single and we like to be mean to them and we label them. We say mean things to them.,0
"Interviewer is Jennifer Borman. So, if you wouldn't mind just take it from the top. Well, Susan has always had it tough because her mother's not around very much.",0
They don't believe us. Would you? Probably not.,0
"I saw mom yesterday. Ugh, yikes, what un unpleasant person. Ugh, yikes, what a mean person.",0
My face itches. Where? I'll scratch it for you.,0
"Areyousure? Yeah, i-i-i took a look around the house and, uh, she's here somewhere. Frank, don'tdo anything.",0
I went by his house and the mail's piled up. We had lunch the day he disappeared. I saw him drive away with a strange woman near the Plaza.,0
You are more than I deserve. Look. I don't care about the stupid show.,0
You can put those handcuffs on now Tom. She should be considered a flight risk. Shoot the cuffs out here please.,0
"Come on, Jenn, it's called tough love. Do you really think I wanted your baby?. I don't need two.",0
Take up your cross and show it! Why'd you do it? Do what?,0
"Dude, that was so totally fucking awesome. I mean, that fucking rocks. What'd you think of her?",0
"I don't know, Penny. "" When a man... "" Loves a woman? "" When a man... "" Is a trucker? The man...",0
She is a goddess among women! Glen! MY phone messages!,0
It gets worse. She killed herself. And I never expected it to go that far.,0
"Yeah, sure. Don't be upset. I'm... I'm not.",0
"Coach Chow. "" Arie. Come on. Leave her alone.",0

"It is so judgy. We're fine. If we were gay, we wouldn't be having this conversation.",0
"Hey, brother. Hey. What are you doing here?",0
"She's a business mistake, a RD gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they?",0
"Things, uh... things are actually cooled down between Carol and me. It's baffling. Just...",0
Please don't do this! I'll give you anything! I barely know her!,0
"I've been thinking I should spend some time with Janet. Why, Dad? I know a lot of women.",0
"When you know I'm the only woman you can have sex with. Oh, yeah... It's getting late.",0
Are you saying in theory you'd really be willing to replace her this way? Don't you think as her mother that might cheapen her memory? If you see what we're doing as frankensteining someone.,0
"Societytries to tell us that women don't want sensitive men, right? That's not true. And I say fuck society. Cry your way back in.",0
"He shamed her into killing herself. Come on, Davis. From what we heard last night, are you in any place to judge?",0
Do you think she heard? Come in! I told grandpa I'd clean up later.,0
Okay. What do some women see in you? Is it the muscles?,0
"Fourteen. Show me, I want to see. You really want to see?",0
I just didn't have it anymore. Oh. And the funny thing was I... I didn't even want to look at art for the longest time.,0
She doesn't want me to call her. Look what you did. Sorry.,0
"You're "" it. "" Now I know why doesn't wanna admit her feelings for him. He's such a flirt. She's probably worried he's gonna cheat on her too.",0
Some fun tonight? Come. What would you like to drink?,0
Right before I moved to New York. She killed herself. I have another job interview today but I'll see you tonight?,0
"Okay, well, good. So... In my, almost expert opinion... you are more sensitive than usual... because you are pregnant.",0
"Dude, she said she doesn't want to, all right? Fine! She's a grown-ass fuckin' adult!",0
Braid her hair. Blow on this. Put this together.,0
"Yeah. Yeah, she's nice. I'm Jackson, by the way.",0
I know. He's got her. I've got ta find her.,0
Right? No. No. I don't know what her problem was. Maybe she'll just forget about it.,0
"Qu? thing? That thing you saw, that living, breathing creature. I believe it.",0
"So if you talk to her, please don't mention anything. Pete. Hey.",0
"Yeah. Soon as we told him what happened, he started talkin' pretty fast. He told us that he and another guy that he was traveling with met up with a woman on a horse, and she gave him that blanket.",0
"You think I'm going to let you sex text her with your sex texting fingers, asshole? I am not your woman anymore, okay? I am not your woman.",0
Guess you can't keep a good woman down. Walk away. It's gonna get ugly.,0
Murray told me to restrain myself. I should have listened. Ruby would today at home with her mother.,0
"He made that? That's really, really complicated. Yeah, he made tons of stuff like this.",0
"They surely do. And it was brought about by one devious schemer who's trying to keep her neck out of the noose as well. My god, Wade, I don't think I've seen a more desperate group of people in my entire life.",0
"Thank you. And folks, she speaks for the real Boston! So the woman you've all been waiting for, Hannah Higgins!",0
"They think they are going to beat me with angry stares. How about some cold air instead? Your turn, Wonder Woman.",0
"Goodbye, explorers. Forget wind turbines and solar panels. She's a great renewable energy source.",0
"Awesome. When'd you get a mustache? If you change that channel one more time, I swear.",0
"Now, hold on! Look, we all have our off days, you know... Hi.",0
"oh, come on, peter! You know a lot of women cite physical bravery as the number one quality in a man? It's a sense of humor. , brave or funny guys?",0
"I should not be a mother right now. And biology is again completely backwards. Like, it's ridiculous to me that a 15-year-old girl can get pregnant easily, but a 45-year-old woman can't.",0
Ow! Goddamn people! Don't mind if I do.,0
"What's happening? Keep that open. It's hot in here, man!",0
"And I love Phil just for that very reason. And I'm so proud of you, and I'm so happy for you and Phil. Whenever I'm lost... or whenever I'm alone, Phil is always there for me.",0

"TUBAL- He's mine! The ark, the beasts, and all of these women are now mine.",0
"After had the baby, Bossa Nova wouldn't sleep with her anymore. So now I have to watch her mope around in a robe... in this vacuous palace of shit! Well, maybe when I'm around you I intuitively mope.",0
"It was cute! And you know, you can never give a shit if somebody gets upset, because no matter what you say publicly, there's always one person who wants to step in the line of fire on purpose, just to get upset, so they get a little attention for themselves. So, this big fat user on Twitter gets mad at me because I used the word, "" fat. "" She's, like, "" Oh, Jim Norton ""... it's, like, first of all, the word "" fat "" there was not meant to attack fat people at all.",0
Her. Whoo! Doggie style. That's not fair.,0
Don't be weird. Just leave her in peace. I... Stop it!,0
Of course. Look at her. She's a princess.,0
"In your mind, count how many times you could have done it. And don't make something up. I know where she goes and what she does.",0
"Pain and destruction and fire are about to rain down on your fair city. For this, I apologize. But one woman has it within her power to stop this apocalypse.",0
I don't understand. Well I think it's absurd. You shouldn't teach students the things that you know.,0
"I can't choose any of these topics. Then follow the rules, or you can leave. I'm sorry, but I don't have time for this every week.",0
"But it just didn't work. And I realized that if if I'm not thinking about her, who is? You know?",0
Simply. They were a long time already? I have no idea.,0
So she should go breathe. It's sex. Grow up.,0
"Hmm, look what the cat dragged in! Herself! Hey, Toralei.",0
"Well, the trees themselves are an extension of the piece. So there's a purpose behind it'? Right.",0
"What is it? "" Cabbie penny needs a potty. "" Wait, what did it start as? "" Katy Perry's a great singer. "" Yeah, she is!",0
"In the arena, women were pitted against animals and other women, but in a real-life battle, there are no such rules. Your opponent's size or sex should not be taken lightly. Reach is an advantage, but speed and agility can overcome a larger opponent.",0
"Nope. Come on, it's easy. Okay.",0
"I mean, I'm dreaming? Last night I was with my dream wife. She was perfect.",0
And then I got an upset stomach and I... I threw up on her. It was fucking terrible. I knew...,0
You are a woman of many talents. When do I get paid for my talents? You're quite outspoken. ,0

"And you, turn that fucker off. Get the fuck out of here! If you want to see your girlfriend alive, make sure you bring my sister in one piece.",0
What happened here? Miss Conrad decided she wanted to earn herself a Purple Heart. Didn't do this on purpose.,0

I'm her mother! She doesn't listen to me. But she might listen to a stranger.,0
I understand what you're going through. She was just so cold. She wasn't herself.,0
"And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two? Are you all right, Honey?... talking to herself... strange. Honey, you should go to bed.",0
"So are you. Hey, did I tell you the proof of concept on our drug passed with flying colors? There's actually a bidding war between a few pharmas right now.",0
"I've always been really, very good with most women. Some Women have always... been incredibly kind to me. And... I really have no... place to go right now and...",0
"Now, what the fuck is going on with you? She's dead. What?",0
"And so I watch him panic, and as he panics, the air hostess comes back down the plane. She goes, "" Hey, what's going on? I need to get the people out. """,0
"Cause my kid has a... a big game tonight, and I'm 50 miles away, dealing with a woman... Well, I'm sorry about that. Who thinks she can manage without bacon!",0
"Not at all. Well, I should have asked. That was sorry about that.",0
No. They're Italian. And that's a woman's cigarette.,0
"She killed herself, didn't she? That's none of your business. Look, you both should leave.",0
Why did she say it looked like an animal bite? She's lying. All doctors are liars.,0
"Actually, I haven't decided -Run now, talk later. All right, warm up. One mile.",0
"Yeah, but I don't know what I'm going to find. Just stay with Curtis and Jones, please? Make sure she doesn't go near the water, all right?",0
"Let it go. No! I'm sorry Brad, but Stacy is a grownup. ",0
"I saw you, you murderer! You fucking murderer! You killed her!",0
I do what she wants. She's a powerful woman and she will punish me. She will punish me severely.,0
"argh! ahh. Please, no. getup.",0
What I'm trying to say is it's almost like I'm writing to spend time with her. Who? The woman I mentioned.,0
"Right here. Yeah, her mom robbed Good Buy. Yeah, totally flipped out.",0
The real person in charge. You should have let him take the blame. For getting every single person in this building killed.,0
May the best one win! Take her down! Hey!,0
"Listen, I've got a dead John bleeding all over my place because of her. What the fuck is going on over there? Oh, you know I can fuck her shit right up.",0
"She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me in two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin. But, alas, I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the munchkin girl, I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.",0
"That's your girl, right? Can you tell me her name? Do you want me to ask her what happened down there?",0

"I mean, do you really think that there is something wrong with every single woman in the world? Or might there possibly be something wrong with, uh... I don't know... you? Why are you guys blaming me?",0
"Yeah, you just said that that's the reason why she did what she did to herself. We're just saying that if enough people are talking about it, they're gonna start asking questions. OK, you all stand right next to me whenever we talk to Jessica.",0
"Don't forget, final papers are due next week. Also, pick up your pop quizzes from yesterday on your way out. You're not gonna be too happy.",0
"Should I have brought a picture of my mom, so we can start up a search party? We didn't misplace her. She must have woke up, got dressed, and decided to check herself out.",0
She was talking to Steve. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Wait. Who'sSteve? Wait. Who'sSteve?,0
